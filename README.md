# test-app

This is my tutorial project for MEAN stack TDD with deployment to Heroku. This project is 
following Michael Hartl's Rails 4 version 2 eBook.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
